# Qualitative-Analysis-of-Big-Data-in-Social-Media
Introduction

In this digital age, social media has become a strong way to talk to people, share knowledge, and change people's minds. The huge amount of user-generated material makes a huge amount of "big data," which is very useful for understanding consumer trends, how people feel about brands, and new problems. Realising the full potential of this data, however, takes a more complex method than just gathering huge amounts of data.

Uses a variety of data sources to get a full picture of online talks about [insert your specific topic of interest here]. This project goes into the world of big data in social media analytics. Our goal is to give a full picture of the public conversation by using both written and spoken material.

Here is a breakdown of how we plan to gather data:

●	Visual Insights: We will look at 200 text-based pictures that we got from Google. This will help us find visual stories and possible memes that are related to the subject.

●	Expert Talk Sessions (MP3): To get advice from professionals, we will listen to 10 MP3 records of conversations with experts on sites like CNBC. 

●	Ted Talks (MP4): We will also look at 10 Ted Talks or expert meetings to find thought leadership and in-depth points of view.

●	Website Scrapping: To learn more about the online world around the topic, we will scrape data from 10 relevant websites. These could be industry studies, news stories, or company blogs.

●	Social Media: We will look at 2,000 comments from Reddit, a famous social media site known for letting people have natural conversations, to get the public's voice.

●	Academic landscape: Finally, we will use a collection of titles or abstracts from the Scopus database to give our research a solid academic base.

By putting these different records together, we'll get a lot of different kinds of information, like how people feel, what experts think, and visual stories. After collecting all the data, we will use world cloud graphics to find the most important buzzwords and themes. Then, Sentiment analysis will be used to find out whether people feel generally positively, negatively, or neutrally about the topic. Lastly, thematic analysis will help us find deeper trends and repeated themes in the data, which will give us a more complete picture of how people think.
